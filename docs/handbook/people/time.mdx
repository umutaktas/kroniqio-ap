title: "Time Off & Working Hours" 
---

We offer the team unlimited PTO **with the expectation that you take at least the minimum time off listed in your contract**, this is to ensure people are taking days off without feeling guilty.


## No Permission Required

We don't require permission for you to take time off, but please make sure you communicate that with the team and ensure they can move forward without you in your absence.  

## Flexible Working

We don't measure the amount of time you work, but rather the impact. If you have an appointment or need to do a quick household chore, please do so without permission, but please make sure it's added to the calendar.

**NOTE:** When choosing your working hours, make sure they are **predictable** for your team and that you can overlap with them in case they want to reach out.
